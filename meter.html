        <h1>Meter</h1>

<p>Meter is a term for the patterns of syllables used in much (English) poetry and song (including metrical Psalms). Six different metrical patterns are used in the <em>Psalms of David in Metre</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Common Meter (CM: 8.6.8.6) - a pattern of:
<ul>
<li>8 syllables for the 1st stanza</li>
<li>6 syllables for the 2nd stanza</li>
<li>8 syllables for the 3rd stanza</li>
<li>6 syllables for the 4th stanza</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Short Meter (SM: 6.6.8.6)</li>
<li>Long Meter (LM: 8.8.8.8)</li>
<li>Hallelujah Meter (HM: 6.6.6.6.8.8)</li>
<li>6s (6.6.6.6)</li>
<li>10s (10.10.10.10.10)</li>
<li>Psalm Meter (PM: 8.7.8.7)</li>
</ul>

<p>Common Meter is used in many well-known hymns such as <em>Amazing Grace</em> and <em>O For a Thousand Tongues</em>. And it's used in one of the best known metrical Psalms -- <em>The Lord's My Shepherd</em> (Psalm 23):</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Amazing Grace</em>
<ul>
<li>Amazing grace, How sweet the sound [8 syllables]</li>
<li>That saved a wretch like me. [6 syllables]</li>
<li>I once was lost, but now I am found, [8 syllables]</li>
<li>Was blind, but now I see. [6 syllables]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>O For a Thousand Tongues</em>
<ul>
<li>O for a thousand tongues to sing [8 syllables]</li>
<li>my great Redeemer's praise, [6 syllables]</li>
<li>the glories of my God and King, [8 syllables]</li>
<li>the triumphs of his grace! [6 syllables]</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>The Lord's My Shepherd</em> (Psalm 23) :
<ul>
<li><sup>1</sup> The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want</li>
<li><sup>2</sup> He makes me down to lie</li>
<li>In pastures green: he leadeth me</li>
<li>the quiet waters by.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>That means that you can sing Psalm 23 to the tune for <em>Amazing Grace</em> (New Britain), to the tune for <em>O for a Thousand Tongues</em>, or to countless other Common Meter (CM) tunes.</p>

<p>The <em>Psalms of David in Metre</em> has a CM version of every Psalm except for one -- Psalm 136. It has two versions of Psalm 136:</p>

<ul>
<li>136A (or 136: 1st version) is in Psalm Meter (PM). One of the best known PM tunes is Galilee, the tune to both <em>Jesus Calls Us</em> and <em>Blest the Man That Fears Jehovah</em>.</li>
<li>136B (or 136: 2nd version) in in Hallelujah Meter (HM)
<ul>
<li>HM is used by Darwall's 148th, the traditional tune for singing Psalm 148B (whose first word in Hebrew is "Hallelujah"). Darwall's 148th is likely best known as the tune to <em>Rejoice the Lord is King!</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>It has a Short Meter (SM) version of four Psalms: Psalms 25A, 45B, 50A, 67A. A well-known SM tune is Diademata, the tune to <em>Crown Him with Many Crowns</em>. Diademata is often used to sing Psalm 50A.</p>

<p>It has a Long Meter (LM) version if three Psalms: Psalms 100A, 102B, and 145 B. One of the best-known LM tunes is The Old 100th, the tune to <em>The Doxology</em> and the traditional tune for Psalm 100A.</p>

<p>The <em>Psalms of David in Metre</em> has a 6.6.6.6 (6s) version of only one Psalm: Psalm 143B. St. Cecilia (Hayne) is the 6s tune to <em>Thy way, not mine, O Lord</em>.</p>

<p>And it has a 10.10.10.10.10 (10s) version of only one Psalm: Psalm 124B. The traditional tune for singing it (<em>Now Israel May Say, and That Truly</em>) is the Old 124th.</p>
