        <h1>The Psalms of David in Metre</h1>

<p><em>The Psalms of David in Metre</em> is also known as the the <em>1650 Scottish Psalter</em>, or simply <em>The Scottish Psalmody</em>. It is a metrical version of the Book of Psalms. It translates every verse of the 150 Hebrew Psalms into English rhyme and <a href="meter.html">meter</a>. For twelve of the Psalms, it has two different translations (each in different meter) to choose from.</p>

<p>The Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) publishes two music editions of <em>The Scottish Psalmody</em>:
1. in staff notation
2. in tonic sol-fa notation - an alternative form of musical notation developed to facilitate sight-singing. [Sight-singing -- also known as vocal sight-reading -- is the ability to both read and sing music "(a) prima vista", which is Italian for "at first sight".]</p>

<p>But I've taken my Psalm portions from Reformation Presbyterian Press's <a href="https://exclusivepsalmody.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/comprehensive-psalter.pdf">Comprehensive Psalter - The Psalms of David in Metre</a>, which I believe is currently out-of-print. The <em>Comprehensive Psalter</em> purposely divides the metrical Psalms into 312 portions. [Depending upon what day of the week a year starts on (and whether it's a leap year), every year has 52 to 53 Lord's Days, and 312 (52x6) to 314 other days.]</p>

<p><a href="http://www.christcovenantrpc.org/">Christ Covenant Reformed Presbyterian Church (CCRPC)</a> of Wylie, Texas (USA) has <a href="http://www.christcovenantrpc.org/audio/psalm-singing/">online recordings of their congregation</a> singing the 312 portions from the <em>Comprehensive Psalter</em>. On the same Web page, they also have a .zip file of <em>Psalter tune MIDI Files</em>, a .pdf <em>Index of Psalm Tunes</em>, and a .pdf <em>Text of the Scottish Psalter</em>.</p>

<p><a href="http://charisdevelopment.com/">Charis Development</a> publishes free mobile apps for this Psalter:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.charisdevelopment.thesixteenfifty&amp;hl=en">1650 Split Leaf Psalter: Android app</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1198280376">1650 Split Leaf Psalter: iOS app</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For every verse of the 150 Psalms, both apps contain:</p>

<ul>
<li>The words to 1 version of the Psalm</li>
<li>The musical scores and MIDI files of suggested tunes</li>
</ul>

<p>Many Psalm portions in the apps also contain links that allow you to play the above-mentioned recordings from CCRPC.</p>
