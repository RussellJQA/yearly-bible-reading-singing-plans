Each year, my wife and I read through the Bible, and sing through the Book of Psalms. Over the years, we've used a number of different Bible reading plans, and I'd like to try something different in 2021. (And to try something else different in the coming years.) Starting in 2021, I'm including our plans here.

For those unfamiliar with Psalm singing, I also include:

- Information on the [Psalms of David in Metre](psalms_of_david_in_metre.md), also known as the *1650 Scottish Psalter* or *Scottish Psalmody*
- Information on [meter](meter.md) (also spelled "metre") -- a term for the patterns of syllables used in much (English) poetry and song (including metrical Psalms)
- A link to [online recordings of congregational Psalm singing](http://www.christcovenantrpc.org/audio/psalm-singing/). The linked-to Web page also has a .zip file of *Psalter tune MIDI Files*, a .pdf *Index of Psalm Tunes*, and a .pdf *Text of the Scottish Psalter*.
- Links to mobile ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.charisdevelopment.thesixteenfifty&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1198280376)) *1650 Scottish Psalter* apps

## 2021 Bible Reading/Singing Plan

For 2021, I used the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language to generate printable versions of a plan of my own:

- [Download PDF (bible_readings.pdf)](2021/bible_readings.pdf?raw=true)

The above printable versions are for the entire plan. But in case someone else is interested in following just a piece of the plan, I also generated separate printable versions for each individual piece:

- Weekday New Testament: Read 1 New Testament chapter each weekday (Monday through Friday)
  - [Download PDF (nt_readings.pdf)](2021/nt_readings.pdf?raw=true)
- Saturdays with Solomon: Read 1 chapter every Saturday from the writings of Solomon (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon)
  - [Download PDF (solomon_readings.pdf)](2021/solomon_readings.pdf?raw=true)
- 6-Day Psalm Reading/Singing: Read 1 Psalm portion from the Bible, and sing the corresponding metrical portion from the [Psalms of David in Metre](psalms_of_david_in_metre.md), 6 days per week (Monday through Saturday)
  - [Download PDF (fpcr\_psalm\_readings.pdf)](2021/fpcr\_psalm\_readings.pdf?raw=true)
- Daily Old Testament: Read 2 other Old Testament chapters each day (Lord's Day through Saturday)
  - [Download PDF (ot\_wo\_david\_and\_solomon\_hebrew\_order\_ho\_readings.pdf)](2021/ot_wo_david_and_solomon_hebrew_order_ho_readings.pdf?raw=true)

For each piece of the plan, I had 1 more day than I had readings to fill it with. So I added some additional readings at the end.
