# Yearly Bible Reading/Singing Plans

Each year, my wife and I read through the Bible, and sing through the Book of Psalms. Over the years, we've used a number of different Bible reading plans, and I'd like to try something different in 2021. (And to try something else different in the coming years.)

## 2021 Bible Reading/Singing Plan

For 2021, I used the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language to generate printable versions of a plan of my own:

The above printable versions are for the entire plan. But in case someone else is interested in following just a piece of the plan, I also generated separate printable versions for each individual piece:

- Weekday New Testament: Read 1 New Testament chapter each weekday (Monday through Friday)
  - [Download PDF (nt_readings.pdf)](2021/nt_readings.pdf?raw=true)
- Saturdays with Solomon: Read 1 chapter every Saturday from the writings of Solomon (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon)
  - [Download PDF (solomon_readings.pdf)](2021/solomon_readings.pdf?raw=true)
- 6-Day Psalm Reading/Singing: Read 1 Psalm portion from the Bible, and sing the corresponding metrical portion from the [Psalms of David in Metre](resources/psalms_of_david_in_metre.md), 6 days per week (Monday through Saturday)
  - [Download PDF (fpcr\_psalm\_readings.pdf)](2021/fpcr\_psalm\_readings.pdf?raw=true)
- Daily Old Testament: Read 2 other Old Testament chapters each day (Lord's Day through Saturday)
  - [Download PDF (ot\_wo\_david\_and\_solomon\_hebrew\_order\_ho\_readings.pdf)](2021/ot_wo_david_and_solomon_hebrew_order_ho_readings.pdf?raw=true)

For each piece of the plan, I had 1 more day than I had readings to fill it with. So I added some additional readings at the end.
