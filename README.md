# Yearly Bible Reading and Singing Plans

Each year, my wife and I read through the Bible, and sing through the Book of Psalms. Over the years, we've used a number of different Bible reading plans, and I'd like to try something different in 2021. (And to try something else different in the coming years.) Starting in [2021](##-2021-bible-reading-and-singing-plan), I'm including our plans here.

For those unfamiliar with Psalm singing, I also include:

- Information on the [Psalms of David in Metre](psalms\_of\_david\_in\_metre.md), also known as the *1650 Scottish Psalter* or *Scottish Psalmody*
- Information on [meter](meter.md) (also spelled "metre") -- a term for the patterns of syllables used in much (English) poetry and song (including metrical Psalms)
- A link to [online recordings of congregational Psalm singing](http://www.christcovenantrpc.org/audio/psalm-singing/). The linked-to Web page also has a .zip file of *Psalter tune MIDI Files*, a .pdf *Index of Psalm Tunes*, and a .pdf *Text of the Scottish Psalter*.
- Links to mobile ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.charisdevelopment.thesixteenfifty&hl=en) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1198280376)) *1650 Scottish Psalter* apps


## 2021 Bible Reading and Singing Plan

For 2021, I used the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language to generate my own plan. Here's a printable .PDF version of the plan:

- [Download PDF of all readings](2021/bible\_readings.pdf?raw=true)

And here's a .zip file of .m3u playlists for playing the corresponding chapters from audio KJV CDs from Talking Bibles International:

The above files are for the entire plan. But if you're just interested in following a piece of the plan, you can download files for its individual pieces below:

  - [Download PDF of NT readings](2021/nt\_readings.pdf?raw=true)
  - [Download Zip of NT playlists](2021/nt\_playlists.zip?raw=true)

- 6-Day Psalm Reading/Singing: Read 1 Psalm portion from the Bible, and sing the corresponding metrical portion from the [Psalms of David in Metre](psalms\_of\_david\_in\_metre.md), 6 days per week (Monday through Saturday)

For each piece of the plan, I had 1 more day than I had readings to fill it with. So I added some additional readings at the end of December 2021.
