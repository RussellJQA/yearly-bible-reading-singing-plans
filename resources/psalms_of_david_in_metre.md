## The Psalms of David in Metre

*The Psalms of David in Metre* is also known as the the *1650 Scottish Psalter*, or simply "The Scottish Psalmody". It is a metrical version of the Book of Psalms. It translates every verse of the 150 Hebrew Psalms into English rhyme and [meter](meter.md). For twelve of the Psalms, it has two different translations (each in different meter) to choose from.

The Free Church of Scotland (Continuing) publishes two music editions of *The Scottish Psalmody*:
1. in staff notation
2. in tonic sol-fa notation - an alternative form of musical notation developed to facilitate sight-singing. [Sight-singing -- also known as vocal sight-reading -- is the ability to both read and sing music "(a) prima vista", which is Italian for "at first sight".]

But I've taken my Psalm portions from Reformation Presbyterian Press's [Comprehensive Psalter - The Psalms of David in Metre](https://exclusivepsalmody.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/comprehensive-psalter.pdf), which I believe is currently out-of-print. The *Comprehensive Psalter* purposely divides the metrical Psalms into 312 portions. [Depending upon what day of the week a year starts on (and whether it's a leap year), every year has 52 to 53 Lord's Days, and 312 (52x6) to 314 other days.]

[Christ Covenant Reformed Presbyterian Church (CCRPC)](http://www.christcovenantrpc.org/) of Wylie, Texas (USA) has [online recordings of their congregation](http://www.christcovenantrpc.org/audio/psalm-singing/) singing the 312 portions from the *Comprehensive Psalter*. On the same Web page, they also have a .zip file of *Psalter tune MIDI Files*, a .pdf *Index of Psalm Tunes*, and a .pdf *Text of the Scottish Psalter*.

[Charis Development](http://charisdevelopment.com/) publishes free mobile apps for this Psalter:
- [1650 Split Leaf Psalter: Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.charisdevelopment.thesixteenfifty&hl=en)
- [1650 Split Leaf Psalter: iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1198280376)

For every verse of the 150 Psalms, both apps contain:
- The words to 1 version of the Psalm
- The musical scores and MIDI files of suggested tunes

Many Psalm portions in the apps also contain links that allow you to play the above-mentioned recordings from CCRPC.
