## Meter

Meter is a term for the patterns of syllables used in much (English) poetry and song. Six different metrical patterns are used in the *Psalms of David in Metre*:
- Common Meter (CM: 8.6.8.6) - a pattern of:
    - 8 syllables for the 1st stanza
    - 6 syllables for the 2nd stanza
    - 8 syllables for the 3rd stanza
    - 6 syllables for the 4th stanza
- Short Meter (SM: 6.6.8.6)
- Long Meter (LM: 8.8.8.8)
- Hallelujah Meter (HM: 6.6.6.6.8.8)
- 6s (6.6.6.6)
- 10s (10.10.10.10.10)
- Psalm Meter (PM: 8.7.8.7)

Common Meter is used in many well-known hymns such as *Amazing Grace* and *O For a Thousand Tongues*. And it's used in one of the best known metrical Psalms -- *The Lord's My Shepherd* (Psalm 23):
- *Amazing Grace*
    - Amazing grace, How sweet the sound  [8 syllables]
    - That saved a wretch like me.  [6 syllables]
    - I once was lost, but now I am found,  [8 syllables]
    - Was blind, but now I see.  [6 syllables]
- *O For a Thousand Tongues*
    - O for a thousand tongues to sing  [8 syllables]
    - my great Redeemer's praise,  [6 syllables]
    - the glories of my God and King,  [8 syllables]
    - the triumphs of his grace!  [6 syllables]
- *The Lord's My Shepherd* (Psalm 23) :
    - <sup>1</sup> The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want
    - <sup>2</sup> He makes me down to lie
    - In pastures green: he leadeth me
    - the quiet waters by.

That means that you can sing Psalm 23 to the tune for *Amazing Grace* (New Britain), to the tune for *O for a Thousand Tongues*, or to countless other Common Meter (CM) tunes.

The *Psalms of David in Metre* has a CM version of every Psalm except for one -- Psalm 136. It has two versions of Psalm 136:
- 136A (or 136: 1st version) is in Psalm Meter (PM). One of the best known PM tunes is Galilee, the tune to both *Jesus Calls Us* and *Blest the Man That Fears Jehovah*.
- 136B (or 136: 2nd version) in in Hallelujah Meter (HM)
    - HM is used by Darwall's 148th, the traditional tune for singing Psalm 148B (whose first word in Hebrew is "Hallelujah"). Darwall's 148th is likely best known as the tune to *Rejoice the Lord is King!*

It has a Short Meter (SM) version of four Psalms: Psalms 25A, 45B, 50A, 67A. A well-known SM tune is Diademata, the tune to *Crown Him with Many Crowns*. Diademata is often used to sing Psalm 50A.

It has a Long Meter (LM) version if three Psalms: Psalms 100A, 102B, and 145 B. One of the best-known LM tunes is The Old 100th, the tune to *The Doxology* and the traditional tune for Psalm 100A.

The *Psalms of David in Metre* has a 6.6.6.6 (6s) version of only one Psalm: Psalm 143B. St. Cecilia (Hayne) is the 6s tune to *Thy way, not mine, O Lord*.

And it has a 10.10.10.10.10 (10s) version of only one Psalm: Psalm 124B. The traditional tune for singing it (*Now Israel May Say, and That Truly*) is the Old 124th.
