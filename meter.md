# Meter

Meter is a term for the patterns of syllables used in much (English) poetry and song. Six different metrical patterns are used in the _Psalms of David in Metre_:

- Common Meter (CM: 8.6.8.6) - a pattern of:
  - 8 syllables for the 1st stanza
  - 6 syllables for the 2nd stanza
  - 8 syllables for the 3rd stanza
  - 6 syllables for the 4th stanza
- Short Meter (SM: 6.6.8.6)
- Long Meter (LM: 8.8.8.8)
- Hallelujah Meter (HM: 6.6.6.6.8.8)
- 6s (6.6.6.6)
- 10s (10.10.10.10.10)
- Psalm Meter (PM: 8.7.8.7)

Common Meter is used in many well-known hymns such as _Amazing Grace_ and _O For a Thousand Tongues_. And it's used in one of the best known metrical Psalms -- _The Lord's My Shepherd_ (Psalm 23):

- _Amazing Grace_
  - Amazing grace, How sweet the sound [8 syllables]
  - That saved a wretch like me. [6 syllables]
  - I once was lost, but now I am found, [8 syllables]
  - Was blind, but now I see. [6 syllables]
- _O For a Thousand Tongues_
  - O for a thousand tongues to sing [8 syllables]
  - my great Redeemer's praise, [6 syllables]
  - the glories of my God and King, [8 syllables]
  - the triumphs of his grace! [6 syllables]
- _The Lord's My Shepherd_ (Psalm 23) :
  - <sup>1</sup> The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want
  - <sup>2</sup> He makes me down to lie
  - In pastures green: he leadeth me
  - the quiet waters by.

That means that you can sing Psalm 23 to the tune for _Amazing Grace_ (New Britain), to the tune for _O for a Thousand Tongues_, or to countless other Common Meter (CM) tunes.

The _Psalms of David in Metre_ has a CM version of every Psalm except for one -- Psalm 136. It has two versions of Psalm 136:

- 136A (or 136: 1st version) is in Psalm Meter (PM). One of the best known PM tunes is Galilee, the tune to both _Jesus Calls Us_ and _Blest the Man That Fears Jehovah_.
- 136B (or 136: 2nd version) in in Hallelujah Meter (HM)
  - HM is used by Darwall's 148th, the traditional tune for singing Psalm 148B (whose first word in Hebrew is "Hallelujah"). Darwall's 148th is likely best known as the tune to _Rejoice the Lord is King!_

It has a Short Meter (SM) version of four Psalms: Psalms 25A, 45B, 50A, 67A. A well-known SM tune is Diademata, the tune to _Crown Him with Many Crowns_. Diademata is often used to sing Psalm 50A.

It has a Long Meter (LM) version if three Psalms: Psalms 100A, 102B, and 145 B. One of the best-known LM tunes is The Old 100th, the tune to _The Doxology_ and the traditional tune for Psalm 100A.

The _Psalms of David in Metre_ has a 6.6.6.6 (6s) version of only one Psalm: Psalm 143B. St. Cecilia (Hayne) is the 6s tune to _Thy way, not mine, O Lord_.

And it has a 10.10.10.10.10 (10s) version of only one Psalm: Psalm 124B. The traditional tune for singing it (_Now Israel May Say, and That Truly_) is the Old 124th.
